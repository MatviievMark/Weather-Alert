# Weather-Alert

In this project I learned about API keys, autification, and enviorment vars 


This program will send an email to a chosen adress, and will alert the reciever when it will rain
For this code to work you will have enter your own api authentic key(the link was provided in the code), your email, password, and the recievers email(no password needed)
